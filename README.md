# nsdc-data-science-projects
This repository contains a collection of data science projects completed as part of my participation in the National Student Data Corps (NSDC). NSDC is a community-driven initiative that provides students with the opportunity to learn data science fundamentals and apply them through practical projects. 

More information about the NSDC and its data science projects can be found here: https://nebigdatahub.org/nsdc/nsdc-data-science-projects/.
